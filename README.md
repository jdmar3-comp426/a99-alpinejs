# Welcome to the Farm!

For our final project, we decided on doing a simple (but fun!) farming incremential game in which a player can harvest and sell potatoes on their own little farm. Our game tracks how many potatoes a player harvests within their inventory as well as how many coins they accumulate by selling their harvest. Additionally, we also track how many times the player logins in so the player can see the dedication they have to their farm!
