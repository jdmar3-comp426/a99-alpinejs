# Welcome to Harvest Town!

For our final project, we decided on doing a simple (but fun!) farming incremential game in which a player can harvest and sell potatoes on their own little farm. Our game tracks how many potatoes a player harvests within their inventory as well as how many coins they accumulate by selling their harvest.
